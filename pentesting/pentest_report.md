# Pentesting Report: Legacy Vulnerability Scanner

## 1. FORTRAN - Overflow Vulnerability
### Description
In the `vuln_calc.f90` file, large integer inputs can cause an overflow. This is a common issue in legacy systems that don't handle input validation properly.
### Exploit
By inputting large numbers like `99999` and `99999`, the program may crash or produce incorrect results.

## 2. COBOL - Banking System Vulnerability
### Description
The banking system in COBOL (`vuln_banking.cbl`) lacks proper transaction validation and security measures like authentication. This could allow unauthorized withdrawals or overdrafts.
### Exploit
Testing negative or unusually large values for withdrawals might bypass the logic, resulting in incorrect balance deductions.

## 3. BASIC - Weak Login System
### Description
The login system in BASIC (`vuln_login.bas`) uses a hardcoded username and password, making it vulnerable to brute force attacks and exposing sensitive credentials.
### Exploit
Using brute force tools, the password (`1234`) can easily be guessed, or the code can be altered to bypass authentication entirely.
